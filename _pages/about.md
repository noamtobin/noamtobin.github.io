Hi, Iâ€™m Noam ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a Financial Mathematics PhD candidate at York University, where I research systemicâ€‘risk modelling in financial networks. Alongside my research, I develop systematic portfolio strategies for realâ€‘world markets as I prepare to transition into industry.

Iâ€™m fascinated by how market participants make decisions, and I'm refining factorâ€‘modelling techniques to capture those dynamics. I also explore highâ€‘dimensional financial data through tensorâ€‘network and quantumâ€‘cognition methods, and Iâ€™m eager to apply reinforcement and inverseâ€‘reinforcement learning to turn advanced algorithms into actionable investment insights.

In my personal time, I practice yoga, compose music, watch films, and study history and cultural anthropology. I also follow emerging trends in tech, science, and geopolitics.
